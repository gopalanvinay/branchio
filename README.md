# Chat Application –– branch.io
A Python web application on a multi-threaded server using socket streams that enables users to branch to fresh conversation topics in real time.

To run and build this project on your machine:
  1. Clone this repository on your local machine.
  2. Enter the “/branchio” directory in your machine.
  3. Run “python server.py” first. 
  4. Run “python client_chat.py”.
  5. For local testing, enter 127.0.0.1 as your host.
  6. The port number by default is set to 33000, but it should work for any number above 5000.
  
 
 Remember to run this first in order to accept client connections! It should say ‘Waiting to connect...’

To branch a conversation to a new topic, simply type the topic in to your message input and click on ‘Branch’. A new branched window with the topic as header should come up.
